           NOTE to the 1922 edition

           I was in Italy when this book was first published.
           A year later (1912) I visited London, and I found
           that most of my friends and acquaintances spoke to
           me of Zu-like-a&mdash;a name which I hardly recognised
           and thoroughly disapproved. I had always thought
           of the lady as Zu-leek-a. Surely it was thus that
           Joseph thought of his Wife, and Selim of his Bride?
           And I do hope that it is thus that any reader of
           these pages will think of Miss Dobson.

                                                M.B.
                                                Rapallo, 1922.
